									<h2 class="major">Oceangate Submersibles</h2>
									<p>OceanGate Inc. is a privately held company which since 2009, has focused on serving the marine subsea market through manned submersible solutions...for industry, research and exploration(1) Historically, the cost of operating manned submersibles has been prohibitively high. Between maintenance costs, mobilization costs, and need for massive ships to transport and launch them, traditional Manned Underwater Vehicles (MUVs) cost upwards of $45,000 a day to operate.<br><br>OceanGate has broken this trend by producing an MUV with a lightweight carbon fiber hull, no need for a tether, and a Mobile Subsea Launch and Recovery System (MSLARS) which can serve as a transport and operation platform in lieu of a large commercial/research vessel. These modifications have brought operation costs down to approximately $20,000 a day. <br><br>MUVs have the unique ability among submersibles to get very close to targets at great depths. With the production of this comparatively low-priced vehicle, and through the use of strategic partnerships, OceanGate is drastically lowering the cost of entry for subsea initiatives. They intend for their vehicles to be used for everything from research to inspection to defense and even for underwater film production. <br><br>The company’s fleet of untethered, self-contained manned submersibles enables teams of experts to collaborate while performing a variety of industrial, research and exploration tasks in harsh and challenging subsea environments(1)

                                    <p>Cyclops 1 new features include an enhanced automated control system to monitor life support, power management, navigation and other critical system diagnostics. Using a combination of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technology and innovative system architecture designed by the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington and OceanGate’s internal engineering group, the automated control system is revolutionizing how manned submersibles operate by reducing time spent on vehicle control and increasing time to achieve mission objectives. This control system also improves mission safety, reducing opportunity for user error.<br><br>OceanGate’s Cyclops program was developed to meet increased demand from government and commercial clients worldwide as they continue to look for the next generation of subsea technology to address the challenges associated with deepwater operations. Cyclops 1allows OceanGate to deploy a current asset as a working prototype for developing technology and software for use in future submersible programs, demonstrating the company’s continued ability to efficiently utilize resources and yet not lose the ability to innovate.</p>

									<h2 class="major">The Virtual Experience</h2>
                                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV3w9byhBO4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									<p>While OceanGate has drastically lowered the price of entry for those looking to explore the deep sea, operating these vehicles is still not cheap. Sending people out in submersibles for training and demonstration purposes is a time-consuming and expensive process. However, with an effective virtual simulation, OceanGate could reduce the costs of training, create better-prepared pilots, and more closely monitor which areas of preparedness need attention before high-stakes missions in the physical ocean. <br><br>As Chalmers noted in The Oxford Handbook of Virtuality(6) [Virtual environments] offer the possibility of simulating potentially complex, dangerous, or threatening real-world experiences in a safe and controlled manner. They can provide a powerful and customizable tool for personalized training that allow the attributes of human behavior in such environments to be examined."(5) <br><br>Currently, OceanGate has no virtual simulation to prepare the crew for subsea missions prior to orientation using a real MUV. When OceanGate stated that they were interested in working with a UW team to create a virtual model for simulation purposes, we were eager to get involved. we wanted to stretch our virtual world-building skills and apply what we'd learned about immersive environments to a compelling underwater experience that would highlight the benefits of virtual training to OceanGate and bring the wonder of submersibles for deep-sea exploration to our peers in Second Life. <br><br>While an environment like Second Life can only go so far in emulating actual controls for a submersible, virtual training takes place in complete environments intended to mimic real-life conditions. As such, rather than simply recreate their product, we designed an environment in which the underwater submersible could be used to carry out specified tasks. This will highlight the spatial immersion of the given environment and allow users to see how the Cyclops will improve tomorrows underwater excursions.
